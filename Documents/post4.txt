Your heart is a muscle, and it gets stronger and healthier if you lead an active life. It's never too late to start exercising, and you don't have to be an athlete. Even taking a brisk walk for 30 minutes a day can make a big difference.

Once you get going, you'll find it pays off. People who don't exercise are almost twice as likely to get heart disease as people who are active.

Regular exercise can help you:

Burn calories
Lower your blood pressure
Reduce LDL "bad" cholesterol
Boost your HDL "good" cholesterol

How to Start Exercising
First, think about what you'd like to do and how fit you are.

What sounds like fun? Would you rather work out on your own, with a trainer, or in a class? Do you want to exercise at home or at a gym?


If you want to do something that's harder than what you can do right now, no problem. You can set a goal and build up to it.

For example, if you want to run, you might start by walking and then add bursts of jogging into your walks. Gradually start running for longer than you walk.

Don't forget to check in with your doctor. They'll make sure you're ready for whatever activity you have in mind and let you know about any limits on what you can do.
