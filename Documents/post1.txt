Eating well and having a healthy lifestyle can help us feel our best – and make a big
difference to our long-term health. So why not make a change today?
The Eatwell Guide shows the proportions in which different types of foods are needed to 
have a well-balanced and healthy diet. The proportions shown are representative of your 
food consumption over the period of a day or even a week, not necessarily each meal time.

Is the Eatwell Guide for me?
The Eatwell Guide applies to most people regardless of weight, dietary restrictions/
preferences or ethnic origin.
However, it doesn’t apply to children under 2 because they have different nutritional needs. 
Between the ages of 2 and 5, children should gradually move to eating the same foods as 
the rest of the family, in the proportions shown on the Eatwell Guide. Anyone with special 
dietary requirements or medical needs might want to check with a registered dietitian on
how to adapt the Eatwell Guide to meet their individual needs.


How can the Eatwell Guide help?
The Eatwell Guide shows the different types of foods and drinks we should consume –
and in what proportions – to have a healthy, balanced diet.
• Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day
• Base meals on potatoes, bread, rice, pasta or other starchy carbohydrates; 
choosing wholegrain versions where possible
• Have some dairy or dairy alternatives (such as soya drinks); choosing lower fat 
and lower sugar options
• Eat some beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins (including 2 portions 
of fish every week, one of which should be oily)
• Choose unsaturated oils and spreads and eat in small amounts
• Drink 6-8 cups/glasses of fluid a day
If consuming foods and drinks high in fat, salt or sugar have these less often and
in small amounts
