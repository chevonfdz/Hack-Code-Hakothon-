Who needs a gym membership? You can work out from the comfort and convenience of your home, and you have a lot of options besides hopping on a stationary bike or treadmill.

Use these tips to set up your at-home exercise routine.

Choose a location. Designate and declutter a spot in your home for your workouts. Don't automatically pick your basement or garage. If it's not an appealing space, you won't want to spend a lot of time there.

Look for an area near where you often sit. An empty corner or a spot near your TV, for instance, could be perfect. Seeing your exercise place may inspire you to get up and move. You don't want it to be out of sight, out of mind.

Buy the necessities. You don't need a lot of fancy gear. For under $100, you can buy some basics, such as an exercise mat, stability ball, resistance bands, and a few dumbbells. Or make your own list, based on what you want to do. What equipment do you need to support your goals?


Add some comforts. Whatever your favorite way to entertain yourself may be, get it ready to go, and then save it to enjoy during your workout.

Make a playlist with songs you love. Download an audiobook you're excited about. Record a whole season of a great show on your DVR, or add it to your streaming queue.

Use the web. Need an instructor? Check the web for online fitness classes. You can find yoga, dance, strength training, and others that you watch from your iPad or computer.
