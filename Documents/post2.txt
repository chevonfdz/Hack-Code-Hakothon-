Fruit and vegetables

Most people know we should be eating more fruit and veg, but many of us aren’t eating 
enough. Fruit and veg should make up just over a third of the food we eat each day.
Aim to eat at least five portions of a variety of fruit and veg each day. If you count how 
many portions you’re having, it might help you increase the amount and variety of 
fruit and veg you eat. Choose from fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced. A portion is 
80g or any of these: 1 apple, banana, pear, orange or other similar-size fruit, 3 heaped 
tablespoons of vegetables, a dessert bowl of salad, 30g of dried fruit (which should be 
kept to mealtimes) or a 150ml glass of fruit juice 
or smoothie (counts as a maximum of one 
portion a day)
